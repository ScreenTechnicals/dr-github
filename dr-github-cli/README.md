# Dr. Github

**Dr. Github** is a cli tool that examines the project from Local or from GitHub repo using AI

## Installation

```

## Get Started

Run the following command to initialize dr-github

```
dr-github init
```

## Start Examining Project

## API Key

- You will need at least a `tier-1` plan of open ai that's all.
- Run the following command to change the api key you want to change

```
dr-github setkey
```

This command will generate a `.env` file with your api key in the repective dir.

## How to Define Conventions(optional) ?

Create a `.drconventions` file in the root dir where you are currently running dr-github cli and define your **conventions** as raw text. It will automatically read that file and use it while reviewing your codes.

## How to ignore files and folders that are not required?

For this `.gitignore` file should be present in the root dir.
It will then automatically generate a `.drignore` file where all your restricted files are defined and if you want you can customize it for local projects but not for repos.
